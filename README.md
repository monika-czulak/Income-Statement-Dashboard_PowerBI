## Summary
The goal of this project is to create a complete Income Statement Dashboard in Power BI that compares two years of financials. The dataset used included simple journal records and a chart of accounts. Based on these sources the data was transformed using Power Query, Data Model was created, and Income Statement categories were calculated and visualized. The numbers were presented in the form of a matrix comparing current- and previous-year values, a donut chart for Net Income Margin, and KPI cards for each of Income Statement categories, including current and previous value, percent change, and a sparkline for 12-month timeline. On top of that the slicers were created to enable filtering by years, months and divisions. As a result, the dashboard facilitated a comprehensive view on financial performance and enabled stakeholders to make informed decisions based on detailed and actionable data.
